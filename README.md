#AI Cyber Labs
Welcome to the AI Cyber Labs GitHub repository! This repository serves as a public clone of our production repository and showcases the integration of our development processes with a robust CI/CD pipeline.

#About AI Cyber Labs
AI Cyber Labs is dedicated to advancing the field of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Our platform at aicyberlabs.net provides cutting-edge solutions to modern cybersecurity challenges, leveraging AI-driven technologies to protect and optimize digital assets.

#Repository Overview
This repository is open to the public and contains a subset of our actual production code. It mirrors the structure and content of our production environment but is designed for public viewing and contribution under specified guidelines.

#Development and Contributions
While we actively develop on test branches, the key integration and deployment processes are managed through our production branch. Here's how our development workflow integrates with our CI/CD system:

#Development: 
All development work occurs in designated test branches within this repository. These branches allow for feature development, experimentation, and pre-release testing without affecting the stability of our main product.

#Merging and Deployment: 
When features are ready and tested, they are merged into the prod branch. A merge to prod triggers our CI/CD pipeline automatically.

#CI/CD Pipeline: 
Our Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is set up with GitHub Actions and integrates directly with AWS. Upon pushing changes to the prod branch, the pipeline performs automated tests and, upon successful completion, deploys the code to our production environment hosted on AWS. This ensures that aicyberlabs.net is always up-to-date with the latest validated features.
